# HeadFirstDesignPattern
Hi there,
this repository is named after one of the famous design books [Head First Design Pattern by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson] and this repo tracks my learning progress of Design patterns/principles and implementing/practicing it.

### Book intro:
Design Patterns–the lessons learned by those who’ve faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on…something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun.

### What this book promises to readers:
- Fourteen core design patterns
- Nine fundamental design principles
- The difference between a pattern and a principle
- How using design patterns can make your team more effective
